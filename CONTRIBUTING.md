There are some pre-configured environments that can be used for linting
and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

```shell
tox -e static        # Static analysis
tox -e lint          # code style
tox -e unit          # unit tests
tox                      # runs 'format', 'lint', and 'unit' environments
```
